# Awesome Book Lists

I love to read books, but sometimes I feel difficult to decide to read which book. A book list gives an order among books that are under the same topic. So it can tell us what books we should read and which book should read first.

:sparkles: Welcome to open an [issue](https://github.com/v4vong/awesome-book-lists/issues/new) to suggest book lists you found.
